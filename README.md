# ExploitationBundle
Bash script that automates the downloading of various exploitation tools. The purpose for this tool is to automate the process of populating your current folder with the different tools you are most likely going to transfer to the target. 

Useful for hacking CTF like machines, HTB, THM and preparing for hacking certifications.

## What Tools does it include?
At the moment this tool will only fetch windows resources. These are: mimikatz (post-exploitation), chisel (for pivoting), powerup (privesc), powerview (privesc, lateral movement), sharphound (privesc, lateral movement), winPEAS (enumeration), conpty (shell with autocomplete), psexec, ghostpack compiled binaries(various exploitation tools) and a few different potato exploit binaries (privesc).

## Dependencies
You will need wget and git; as an optional tool, impacket. Both tools will probably already be installed in your machine, if not you can use the following command in your kali to get both:

```bash
sudo apt install wget && sudo apt install impacket-scripts
```

## Usage
Make a 'tools' directory and inside run the script:

```bash
mkdir tools
cd tools
chmod +x get_windows_tools.sh && ./get_windows_tools.sh
```

Your final folder will look like this:

```bash
ls
 chisel                       SharpHound               PowerUp.ps1
 Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries   get_windows_tools.sh     PowerView.ps1
 mimikatz                     GetCLSID.ps1             winPEASany.exe
 seImpersonate                Invoke-ConPtyShell.ps1
```

### File Transfer - SMB & HTTP

Once these tools have been downloaded, *if SMB is enabled in the machine*, I suggest starting an impacket-smbserver within 'tools'. Otherwise, You could use python3 -m http.server PORT or any other method you like depending on your access.

```bash
impacket-smbserver kali . -smb2support
# or
python3 -m http.server 80
```
